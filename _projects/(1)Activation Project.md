## My Role in this Project

I was the lead product manager on this project. I was responsible for the entire end to end product lifecycle, from identification of the problem, problem scoping, discovery research through to delivery, launch and post launch validation.

## The Problem

Our primary acquisition strategy was content marketing. We had 2 parts of our business - the Simply Wall St application (a freemium SaaS product) and Simply Wall St News (a free News site providing analysis on individual stocks world-wide).

Our news site receives over 1 Million unique monthly readers. We partnered with Apple, Google and Yahoo to syndicate our news articles. A typical user would:
- Search Google for a stock
- Click on our article
- Read our article
- Click a link in the article which took them to our website
- Scroll through our website and receive a prompt to register
- Create an account and automatically begin a free trial

Whilst this was an extremely efficient funnel, leading to over 17,000 new accounts a week, a very low proportion of them stuck around after their first session.

According to the [Pirate Metrics]([https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version]) (of which I believe any feature a PM is working on should be tied to at least one of those outcomes) we were amazing at Acquisition, but very poor at Activation and Retention.

## Success metrics

I asked myself 3 key questions before developing a deeper understanding of the problem:

**1) What is the *business goal* we're trying to achieve?**

This was pretty simple: *Reduce drop-off rates after a user's first session*

**2) What is the *user goal* we're trying to achieve**

As Des Traynor from Intercom (one of my favourite product leaders) [once said](#https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-on-product-rethinking-outcomes-over-outputs/) in a great podcast with Intercom Head of Product Paul Adams, all business problems should be able to be framed into a customer problem.

The customer problem was clear - *How can we increase the value a user derives from our product on their first session*?

**3) How will we know we were *successful*?**

I generally like to have primary and secondary success measures. In this case, our primary success metric was number of users returning for a second session. Our secondary success metrics was number of active users post trial (free + paid).


## Discovery Research

I started off by documenting the research plan (I have over time developed my [UX Research template](#) I use before any research project), which included all the assumptions our team had from my stakeholder interviews. Our core research question became **why are users dropping off after their first session and not returning?**.

- **Stakeholder interviews:**

I conducted some stakeholder interviews to gather our assumptions on why this was happening.The overall assumptions our stakeholders had were:

*Usability*: the platform on first use is confusing, overwhelming and untrustworthy  

*Communicating Value Proposition*: we aren't succeeding at communicating the product's value during registration and onboarding

*Product/Market Fit* our product is currently not solving well enough the jobs that our target audience has (this is largely a product/channel fit issue)

- **Analytics:**

I looked at our existing quantitative data. We're a very data driven team, so I analyzed relevant acquisition and activation metrics to understand the efficacy of our funnel and where users are failing.


- **Surveys:**

| Learning Objective| Target Audience | Research |Key Findings|
|-----| |-----| -----|-----|
| What are users motivations when coming to a news article? | new users | Quick survey popup while users were reading an article: 1) What brought you to this article? 2) What's your relationship to this stock?| Majority of readers were on an article of a stock they owned |
| Why do users return for a second session? | returning users | Quick survey popup when a user returned for second session: What is the purpose of your visit back to Simply Wall St today? | Over 40% of users were coming to research a specific stock, with 75% of all those users researching a general overview of that stock. The remainder wanted a specific piece of information  |
| What do active users find most valuable about us? | active users | Email sent to subset of paid customers, asking them to answer a survey: 1) How would you explain Simply Wall St to a friend? 2) What do you find most valuable about Simply Wall St? | The core drivers of value to users were the visual nature our analysis, our simplification of the stock research process, and saving them time on their research |
| Why do users churn after first session? | churned users | Email sent to users who signed up and didn't return for 5 days, asking: Why did you decide to stop using Simply Wall St? Once we saw common responses, we turned it into a survey with multi-choice answers and follow up questions based on their responses | main reason they didn't come back was 'didn't have enough time' which in PM language can be translated to 'I didn't find the product valuable enough to come back to'. Second most common reason was that it was too expensive. For users who selected this answer, we had a follow up question asking if they knew we had a free plan. 80% of users said no. Since 79% of our active users were free users, we thought as a low hanging fruit we could optimize the onboarding experience by better communicate the free plan. This improved number of free post trial active users but ended up hurting our revenue funnel, no surprises. We ended up rolling back the changes - lesson learnt |

- **User Interviews:**

 We set up two rounds of in person research, one with our existing users and one with investors who'd never come across our product before.
