- Good here to mention setting up our different feedback channels, hooking them all up into slack and PB.

## My Role in this Project

I was the lead product manager on this project. I was responsible for the entire end to end product lifecycle, from identification of the problem, problem scoping, discovery research through to delivery, launch and post launch validation.

## The Problem

Our primary acquisition strategy was content marketing. We had 2 parts of our business - the Simply Wall St application (a freemium SaaS product) and Simply Wall St News (a free News site providing analysis on individual stocks world-wide).

Our news site receives over 1 Million unique monthly readers. We partnered with Apple, Google and Yahoo to syndicate our news articles. A typical user would:
- Search Google for a stock
- Click on our article
- Read our article
- Click a link in the article which took them to our website
- Scroll through our website and receive a prompt to register
- Create an account and automatically begin a free trial

**PROVIDE A GIF OF THE FLOW!**

Whilst this was an extremely efficient funnel, leading to over 17,000 new accounts a week, a very low proportion of them stuck around after their first session.

According to the [Pirate Metrics]([https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version]) (of which I believe any feature a PM is working on can be tied to at least one of those outcomes) we were amazing at Acquisition, but very poor at Activation and Retention.
