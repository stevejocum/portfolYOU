# **About Me**

Hi I'm **Steve**,

I am an empathetic, entrepreneurial Product Manager. My love of psychology makes me incredibly passionate about listening to users empathetically and understanding their problems deeply. My love of software and design helps me ensure my team's products create beautiful user experiences. And my love for business and strategy makes sure that my team delivers real business outcomes, not just output.

# **Principles**

<!--<img align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://i.ibb.co/tYvp5G0/customer-service.png" alt="Front Lines Image">-->

## Be on the Front Lines
<br>
Maintain high level of contact with users. As the owner of the customers problems, I need to stay on top of what customers are doing and what issues they are facing. Support tickets, account cancellations, customer calls and everything in between.

## Solve the Job
<br>
Users are excellent at telling you their problems, not the solutions to those problems. Customers own the problems and you own the solution. Don’t give them what they ask for, solve the underlying job that they want to get done.

## Validate Early
<br>
The later you validate something in the product development process, the higher the cost of being wrong. Whether validating a problem, the value of a solution or the business impact of a feature, do it as early as possible.

## Bring it Back
<br>
When making decisions, always make it in relation to the user, the problem you’re solving and outcome we're trying to achieve. Don't get side-tracked with designs, features and embellishments. Constantly re-centre the team when we start going down a rabbit hole that's losing focus of the core objective.

## Marry Qual and Quant
<br>
Quant data tells you what the problems are, Qual data tells you why they exist. Quant tells you what users do, Qual tells you what users want. None is more important than the other, but together they empower informed decisions.

## Don't Let the Dust Pile Up
<br>
Don’t launch features only to move on to the next release and never return. Gather qual and quant feedback post launch - how are customers using what you shipped? Are they using it in the way you intended it? Did it effectively solve their problem?  Did it achieve the business outcome we intended? Do they have feedback on how it can be improved?

## Outcome > Output
<br>
Shipping something is not a success. Shipping something that solves the customer problem, creates value for users and creates value for our company is a success. Always measure whether what we launch achieves the result we set out when building it.
