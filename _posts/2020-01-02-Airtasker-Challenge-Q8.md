**Question 8:** *Your team has a long backlog of features to build and bugs to fix when a colleague suggests a new strategy that has the potential to 10x your product's growth. You look at it and think it is well thought-through. What would you do?*

## The Right 'Growth'?

Firstly, I'd want to understand exactly what we mean by ‚Äògrowth‚Äô. Is this active users of feature? Retention? Revenue? There are many dimensions to growth, and I'd want to make sure that the{% include elements/highlight.html text="growth my colleague is trying to target with this strategy is aligned to the growth metrics that matter to our team and company." %} If our company's primary objective is to improve profitability and this strategy will just increase active users of a free feature of the platform, then immediately it might not be a fit for the business right now and not something I'd want to pursue. However, for the purposes of this question I will assume that the dimension of growth that this strategy would help move is aligned to what my team is trying to achieve and a 10x result would undoubtedly be something we'd want at Airtasker.

## Embracing All Ideas

I think it‚Äôs extremely important to embrace all new ideas from team mates on how we can better our business, drive revenue/profitability growth, improve value for Taskers and Posters, and move forward our mission of empowering more people to realize the full value of their skills. People should never feel scared to come forward with initiatives they think can add value to our company, because the best ideas often come from people at all levels, teams and domains in the business, whether an Engineer, Data Scientist, Designer, PM or Support rep. So first up, I'd actually{% include elements/highlight.html text="thank them for bringing this idea forward and make them feel valued, important and a sense of contribution." %}

## Don't Jump Straight In

Whilst it's important to encourage ideas, it's important not to act on all of them. Whilst no one wants to have their ideas shut down,{% include elements/highlight.html text="a culture where the most 'interesting' or 'loudest' idea gets pursued is not a healthy one" %}as they need to consider many contextual factors about the business, the user, what currently problems we're working on and what our team and company objectives are (that job falls on the PM üëçüèº). I once had a colleague who at a team meeting got extremely aggressive about an idea they thought we would be silly to not pursue. Whilst it was a very valid point they were making, I explained that it is something that will be considered but given the current context of the business, it's not something that makes the most sense right now. It was a really difficult conversation but very important for them to understand how products get built and initiatives get worked on in modern product teams.

In this scenario though, the question stated that I think my colleague's proposal is well thought through and if executed correctly can have a dramatic positive impact on my product. So, I'd want to pursue it further but would not take this to my broader team and senior leaders as a next step. I want to make sure when I bring this to my colleagues and senior leaders, that this is not just a little idea that might be worth pursuing. It needs to be thought through and have clear next steps.

<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">I better have something well thought out before bringing this to the team...</figcaption>

## Let the Dust Settle

I'm also a big believer that{% include elements/highlight.html text="patterns which repeat themselves are generally signs that something may be worth pursuing." %} I've found time and time again that if a particular problem keeps recurring, or a certain initiative we've been considering continues to surface, it's generally a sign that we're still thinking about it and it might be worth us investigating it further.

When I get lots of new ideas, I always write them down and make sure to revisit them, but I first give it a few days or a week to let the idea simmer and see if it is still gnawing at me and continuing to come up from colleagues, customers and stakeholders.

## Sounding Board with Colleagues

I'd sit down with my colleague to go through the strategy with them in more detail. This would give me a much more holistic view of the strategy and be the next layer of filtering to decide whether I think it still has potential, or if perhaps our expectations have been tapered a bit. I'd want to discuss with them things like:

- How would it work?
- Do we really think it will have a 10x impact? Why?
- What do we currently know?
- What do we currently not know?
- What assumptions do we need to validate?
- What needs to be true for it to work?
- What risks are there in pursuing this strategy? (business, design/usability, technical/feasibility, implementation, go-to-market)
- Besides the 10x positive impact, would this negatively impact other areas of the product and broader company?

I'd also want to sit down for a coffee with some of my other product peers (e.g. PM colleagues from other product teams) and ask them similar questions. They would be amazing sounding boards and really help me refine my understanding of the strategy, and perhaps spot some risks, factors and ideas I hadn't yet considered.

## Validation and Prepare Document

Considering I still feel this is something worth pursuing and has now had a bit more filtering, I'd want to{% include elements/highlight.html text="prepare something for my colleagues and seniors to read asynchronously" %}(I always prefer giving people the opportunity to sit with new information and think through it as opposed to having to form a half-baked opinion on the spot when hearing about it for the first time).

My document would include things like:
- **Purpose of the initiative** - problem or job-to-be-done we're solving, what metric we believe it can improve, how much and why
- **Background and Context** - any preliminary desk research, colleague interviews, previous user research and any qual & quant data I was able to gather to cursorily better understand the problem and assess the impact of the solution
- **Proposed solution** - what the initiative is and how we envision it working
- **Risks** - areas of concern which we'll need to validate in order to be comfortable implementing this. It be anything from technical implications to clash with other functions and products in the organization
- **Resources and Time Box** - what and would be involved in the project, time estimates (research, design, engineering etc)
- **Basic research plan** - quick overview of next steps if we decided to pursue this (I have over time developed a simple but effective <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qu5Mdh4pcNj3TXpbUWX067H1Xz9N0M8gdaJoyg9_Wbk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">UX Research Template</a> that I use whenever I need to validate something through user research)  

When I think it's ready, I'd send an email or slack message to a group of people I think are relevant to send this to so I can get their thoughts and hopefully get some tough questions. Considering I would have already spoken to my PM colleagues to better filter the idea, I would probably want to send this to someone like Nico, who is in the position to decide what makes sense for us to be pursuing as a product organization. I'd feel comfortable with this considering I haven't just sent him a message with an idea, but rather something that has been carefully considered.

## Backlog

Intertwined with all of this is consideration of the long backlog of features to build and bugs to fix, as{% include elements/highlight.html text="the decision to pursue this strategy (or spend more time on it's scope and validation) is dependent on the criticality of what we had already planned to ship." %} It‚Äôs really important that I have a better understanding of our backlog:
- What do these entail? What do we actually have planned?
- Why those? Why specifically have we chosen these bugs and features to build?
- How critical are these to the business?

If my team was really knee deep in a product initiative and it was really critical for the business (which I assume anything we're working on is because we're solving important customer and business problems), I likely wouldn't have all this time to go and validate this strategy. In that case, I'd either park it for now and circle back later, or just speed up the feedback process and bring it to colleagues and some senior leaders earlier in a more casual manner to see if at a quick glance there is enthusiasm about it's potential.

We may be working on a massive infrastructure change (e.g. refactor of our payments API) which is urgent and important because many Taskers are unable to receive payments. Things like this are critical and urgent, so I would certainly not wish to prioritize an idea that can 10x growth if we had pressing issues like this in our product.

{% include elements/highlight.html text="For bugs and platform issues, I'd use a Frequency x Severity matrix to categorize and prioritize them." %} I'd first and foremost want to see which tasks in that backlog are high frequency and high severity and prioritize those. For those which are low frequency but high severity or high frequency but low severity, I'd look at how high impact those issues are for our business and make a call on them.

 <br>

I'd also look to see{% include elements/highlight.html text="which features in the backlog are urgent and important and prioritize those." %} If there are any which are not urgent but important, I'd look deeper at what the feature is, what metrics we are trying to move with it and the research that's gone into it to make a call on a case by case basis. I'd ignore any features which are urgent and not important, or not urgent and not important.
