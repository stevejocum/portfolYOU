**Question 16:** *What is important to you in your career?*

---

From my career, I want more than a 9-5 job. With work taking up almost 50% of my life (and with Product Managers being naturally passionate people) I care a lot about my work, my craft, the problems I'm working on and the people I do it with.

Here's what is really important me:

## Making an Impact 🌎

I want to be working on problems that I really care about that help move the world forward in a direction I believe in. As a Product Manager, I find it very hard to work on problems that don't truly excite me and make me want to jump out of bed in the morning.

While a lot of my friends started their careers in the corporate world I naturally veered towards the world of startups and technology. I just found it so exciting that with software, people could create something from absolutely nothing that could have such a positive impact on people's lives. I love being a Product Manager because everyday I get to build things with my team that help make people’s lives better.

## Personal growth 🤓

I’ve always been very passionate about personal growth, learning and development. I hate standing still and feel an internal sense of discomfort when I finish a day and feel like if I haven’t improved or learnt something new. I want to master my craft and be the best PM I can be (professionally) and the best human being I can be (personally).

I love to read voraciously, continually trying to learn from the best Product Leaders to become the best PM I can be, and expand my knowledge on important and interesting topics in the world. I have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/hU6iwmbR/books" target="_blank">never ending reading list</a> that perpetually grows.  

Whatever organization I am in, I need to feel a sense of growth and learning and that I’m being challenged every day to become better. ￼Additionally, it is important for me to know that I can advance in the organization and in my role as I demonstrate my abilities, improvement in skills and desire to grow my responsibilities.

## Connecting to people 👬

At my core, I am a people person. I think my best trait is my Emotional IQ. I love understanding people, listening and empathising to get to the best results (both for users and my colleagues). Doing user interviews (something I love so much) is the closest I get to being a psychologist 👨‍⚕️ and getting to deeply listen and understand people and their problems. It brings me a lot of happiness and meaning.

Work consumes such a big part of our lives, and the only inevitability in life (besides death and taxes) is that you have to work with people. For me, that's a prospect I truly relish. In my career, I want the ability to collaborate and develop deep relationships with diverse people who all have unique skills, personalities and characteristics. I'm a big believer that every single person you interact has so much to share with the world, knows something you don't and can help you be a better person.

## Leading and growing others 👨‍🏫

In my life, I know for a fact that I want to be leading others. I have always strived to put myself in leadership positions, from being a school prefect in Year 12 to starting a society at uni and leading a team, as well as taking initiative at my current company to be a leader in any situation I can.

Whilst the role of a product manager is to lead a team (not manage them), my medium to long term goal is to officially lead a team of other product managers and head up a product team. For me, that has nothing to do with title and status - it’s just where I feel I can add the most value in an organization and help others fulfil their potential.
