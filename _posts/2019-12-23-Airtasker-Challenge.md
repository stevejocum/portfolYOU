## Intro and Thanks

Firstly, thank you for the opportunity to complete this challenge and for reading through my work. I loved every minute of the 2 and a half weeks I spent on it (roughly 24 hours of actual work).

I felt the questions deserved a lot of time to sit with and write a response which does justice to the time and energy spent carefully crafting them. I also wanted to show that the opportunity of being a Product Manager at Airtasker, a company I have held in such high regard since I was a teenager, is not a prospect I take lightly. I do not wish to do a quick job to just get the challenge submitted. I wish to demonstrate my abilities and deep desire to join you all on your mission to empower people to realize the full value of their skills.  

For me, it was really important to develop as deep an understanding of the product and customer experience as possible, which is why I both completed a task and posted a task as part of my submission.

## My Experience as a Tasker and Poster

Besides wanting to put myself in the shoes of a user as empathetically as possible, I also wanted to speak to an Airtasker member about their experience. So, that's what I did for my task:
