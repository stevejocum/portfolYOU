**Question 9:** *A teammate suggests we build a product that helps instantly match demand and supply. But another thinks this cannot be done because unlike transportation, the jobs being done on Airtasker are too complex and we can never fully scope every one of them upfront. How would you approach such a problem?*

## Intro and Thanks

Firstly, thank you for the opportunity to complete this challenge and for reading through my work. I loved every minute of the 2 and a half weeks I spent on it (roughly 24 hours of actual work).
