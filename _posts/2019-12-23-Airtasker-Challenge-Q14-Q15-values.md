# Why Values Matter

While a mission is what a company wants to do, values are the principles which govern how they do it. For me to work anywhere, my values need to align to the organizations values. I was very glad to see such alignment when studying your principles for working.

## Stay Open üôåüèº


### What it Means

To me, this value is about being transparent and honest both internally and externally. This involves openly communicating and sharing about the good and bad at Airtasker, what we‚Äôre working on, why we're working on it, our goals and where we are heading.

**External**

This is about being open with our community and public. I saw <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/blog/exciting-news-weve-raised-33m/" target="_blank">Tim‚Äôs post when Airtasker raised $33M</a> in 2017 and how he spoke about all the problems Airtasker was having, including having a number of key personnel leave in quick succession because the people culture and HR was poor. By being vulnerable and admitting when things go wrong, not only does this take a weight off our shoulders by having nothing to hide, but it is endearing and attracts high quality people to our community, from Taskers and Posters all the way to investors and employees.

**Internal**  

This is about being open with our employees and internal stakeholders and ensuring everyone is in the loop of what really matters in the business. When I met with Jerome for my interview, he told me that every week Tim has a company all hands meeting to run everybody through the numbers and what‚Äôs going on. I also couldn‚Äôt believe the level of transparency Jerome displayed about Airtasker - where we are at, our struggles, our achievements, our biggest focus and where we are going. Sitting at that booth inside your offices for my interview, I truly felt like an insider, not an outsider.

**Open Minded**

I also think this value is about being open to exploring opportunities. Embrace all ideas and be willing to take on big challenges that might seem scary at first, but that we can do it together as a team.

### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

Communication is one of the most critical things about being a PM. Engineers should not be told what to build. They should be told why we're building it. Colleagues shouldn‚Äôt just see the end result of what we build. They should know the journey we took. I think being honest and open about what we‚Äôre doing is incredibly important. I also think a PM should always be open about mistakes and take blame when something did not work.

For me personally, the feeling of having nothing to hide is very liberating and allows me to express my true self - that is critical for building a world class company culture and attracting the best, most authentic people to the team.

## Fit for Purpose üí™üèª


### What it Means

I believe this value is about making sure what we do solves the problem and meets the objective we set out. We don‚Äôt do things for the sake of it, but are very intentional about what we build for our community and make sure there is a reason for working on something or pursuing an initiative.

We don‚Äôt try to make things more attractive by trying to add lots of features, details and decorations. We are focused on diligently solving the job or problem at hand.


### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

I love building things that solve a problem and have a clear purpose. This is why I like to spend a lot of time understanding the problems before coming up with solutions. 'Fit for Purpose' is rooted in sound product principles. As Product Managers, we always ask why - why are we working on this? Why would this help our Posters and Taskers? It means that what we build has purpose and intention and is aimed at achieving a user and business outcome.

I don‚Äôt like making things over indulgent and over complex. What I build needs to be simple enough that it achieves what we set out to do, without needing to go over the top. When we say we don‚Äôt embellish, it means that a PM must know what a features are enough to have value for customers and solve the intended purpose, and at what point we‚Äôre able to ship. This means we might not spend that extra 2 weeks adding all those additional things we think are really cool, because we know what we‚Äôve done is enough to ship and solve the problem at hand.

In essence, 'Fit for Purpose' provides me an anchor to bring things back and make sure any decision we make is solving the job we care about.


## People Matter üíô


### What it Means

Both our internal employees and our community members (Posters and Taskers) are not just cogs in a wheel. They are all unique individuals who contribute to our organization and society in a very meaningful way.

- Internal stakeholders (i.e. the team) - how we treat each other. Not putting results ahead of relationships (balancing results and relationships. Treating each other with respect. Helping out each other to get stuff done etc
- As Branson quotes, look after your internal customers (team, staff) they way you want them to look after your external customers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
    - Treat your internal customers the way you want them to treat your external customers

### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

WRITE SOMETHING

## When its On its On ‚ö°Ô∏è

### What it Means

We work hard to get our work done and ship value to customers, and take pride in that. But, there is more to work than just working hard. When we achieve something, ship something to customers, have a great outcome from the work we‚Äôve done, we celebrate the win and acknowledge all of the people who made it possible.

We oscillate between these two modes and find a successful balance. If we don‚Äôt take the time to take the foot off the break and celebrate our success, than we will never be effective and will burn out. Likewise, if we always celebrate and party, we‚Äôll never be a results oriented company  

### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

WRITE SOMETHING

## Own it üíØ


### What it Means

- Take responsibility
- Choose your own attitude
- Take ownership and accountability for your ideas, actions and behaviours
- Be assertive, open and honest but with respect
- Don‚Äôt deflect blame (v important for PM to take accountability and be held responsible when a result doesn‚Äôt come to fruition)


### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

- Actively seeking feedback from users and acting on that
    - Actively soliciting feedback from users (proactively seeking it and also taking it onboard when not asked for - e.g. a complaint)
- Actively seeking feedback from my peers
