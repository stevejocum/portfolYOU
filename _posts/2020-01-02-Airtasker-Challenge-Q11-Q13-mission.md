**Question 11-13:** *Our mission is to empower people to realise the full value of their skills. What is your interpretation of this? Why is this important to you? What do you think this looks like for Airtasker?*

# My Interpretation

Wow. That's a pretty bold mission. I think it's quite deep and am certain a lot of thought was put into it with much back and forth deliberation from leadership and the broader team to find such a crisp mission that encapsulates why we exist.

## Marketplace

As a 2-sided marketplace, I think this mission has dual meaning for both a Tasker and a Poster, the two groups of people that breath life into Airtasker and allow the organization to exist.

### Taskers üèÉ‚Äç

As The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmzfG_fpd4" target="_blank">"The best person for the job isn't always who you think" Ad campaign</a> in March 2019 mentioned, everyone's got something they're skilled at. We all have that one thing that our friends know to come to us for because we're really competent at it. Sadly, before Airtasker existed I think a lot of these people weren't able to exercise those skills and reach their full potential, and many people may have had hidden skills that lay dormant because they didn't have the platform to enable its discovery.

We unlock a totally new way for Taskers to make extra income, probably many ways they hadn't thought about before (want to be a <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/tasks/brand-ambassador-18070698/" target="_blank">"Brand Ambassador</a> üì£? How about a  <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/tasks/treadmill-mechanic-18070569/" target="_blank">"Treadmill Expert</a> üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è?). But just as important, we give them the opportunity to grow existing skills and add new ones to their tool belt.

An experienced HR professional who‚Äôs highly skilled at resume and cover letter writing can help hundreds of Posters with their job applications and master her craft. On the other end, a Tasker who just wants to make some extra income and begins to help out people with their social media, proof reading documents and mystery shopping, all of a sudden unlocks a whole range of skills she may have never known she had. These can now be put to commercial use and to help people.

### Posters ‚úèÔ∏è

 I believe the most effective way to achieve mastery of skills is to spend more time on the things you‚Äôre good at while delegating the things you‚Äôre less competent at or have little time for. And with the busy lives people lead today, we're all time poor and can never get everything we want done. I think most of the tasks people post on Airtasker are outsourcing tasks. Posters don‚Äôt want to clean their house. They'd rather spend that time with their kids to become a better parent. Or a really great entrepreneur who's not very technical wants someone to help set up their online website so they can spend more time building relationships with clients and getting their new business of the ground. Airtasker frees up these people to focus on their priorities and the skills they wish to pursue most.

## Unique Individuals

I also interpret this to mean that each Airtasker member is encouraged to be a unique individual with their own skillset. The Ad campaign I mentioned earlier is a testament to this. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmzfG_fpd4" target="_blank">ad mentions</a> things like:

> Everyone's got something they want to do

> Everyone's got something they're skilled at

> Everyone's got something

That's why I think the mission suggests that we as an organization believe everyone has something to give. Every single Tasker on the platform has some skill, or set of skills that are unique to them which they can realize or master through Airtasker.

Tim also spoke about this a lot <a href="http://theconversation.com/full-response-from-airtasker-ceo-tim-fung-77009" target="_blank">in 2017 when he responded</a> to the lack of minimum wages and conditions Airtasker was being scrutinised for. He said that we empower our community to agree on an individual price for every individual task {% include elements/highlight.html text="based on the unique skills and circumstances of that individual" %}. He said each individual person has freedom to quote what they want based on their unique circumstances and skills. It might take one person 5 hours to complete a certain task but may take another person 30 minutes. He said enforcing rigid wages would {% include elements/highlight.html text="ignore an individual‚Äôs unique skills and 'commoditise' people" %}.

# Why it's Important to Me

In his perennial book, Drive, Daniel Pink said all humans want 3 things from their careers - Autonomy (the ability to be self-directed), Mastery (competence and proficiency at something) and Purpose (the feeling of contributing to something greater than yourself). Our work dominates our waking life, and if people can realize the full value of their skills, more people can lead better quality lives.

Airtasker's mission resonates with me pretty deeply because I'm someone who constantly strives to become the best version of myself and realize the full value of my own skills. I place professional development and personal growth above many things in my life, especially when trying to become the best Product Manager I can be. Being a PM is a role requiring many skills, and I always find it tough to know which skill I should be trying to improve at any given point in time (Business Strategy, User Research, Data Analytics, Technical Knowledge, Psychology, Public Speaking..... the list never ends). But with so much going on in my life, I have to outsource and delegate the lower value things to make space for my personal and professional growth. Otherwise, I will never be free enough to realize the full value of my skills.

It‚Äôs also an extremely important mission to me because I have to preach this maxim every day in my role. Being a PM is very cross functional. My role isn‚Äôt to be the best designer, the best engineer, the best marketer or the best customer support. It's to galvanize my team to do the best work they can and realize the full value of their skills.

# What This Looks Like for Airtasker

Airtasker facilitates the connection of people wanting to get stuff done and those willing to do it. By nature, we're helping each party best enable their skills. It's about connecting the right people with the right skills to the right job.

Airtasker achieves this mission simply by being an enabler. We give people the tools and resources to unlock and enhance their skills. We enable people to get things done they don't want to do themselves, and people to complete those tasks and earn extra income. Airtasker puts the frameworks and structures in place for everyday jobs to get done that help make people's lives better and let each party do what they want most.
