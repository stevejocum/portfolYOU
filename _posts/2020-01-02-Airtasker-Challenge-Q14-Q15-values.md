# Why Values Matter

While a mission is what a company wants to do, values are the principles which govern how they do it. For me to work anywhere, my values need to align to the organizations values. I was very glad to see such alignment when studying your principles for working.

## Stay Open üôåüèº


### What it Means

This value is about being transparent and honest both internally and externally. This involves openly communicating and sharing about the good and bad at Airtasker, what we‚Äôre working on, why we‚Äôre working on it, our goals and where we are heading.

**External**

This is about being open with our community and public. I saw <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/blog/exciting-news-weve-raised-33m/" target="_blank">Tim‚Äôs post when Airtasker raised $33M</a> in 2017 and how he spoke about all the problems Airtasker was having, including having a number of key personnel leave in quick succession because the people culture and HR was poor. By being vulnerable and admitting when things go wrong, not only does this take a weight off our shoulders by having nothing to hide, but it is endearing and attracts high quality people to our community, from Taskers and Posters all the way to investors and employees.

**Internal**  

This is about being open with our employees and internal stakeholders and ensuring everyone is in the loop of what really matters in the business. When I met with Jerome for my interview, he told me that every week Tim has a company all hands meeting to run everybody through the numbers and what‚Äôs going on. I also couldn‚Äôt believe the level of transparency Jerome displayed about Airtasker - where we are at, our struggles, our achievements, our biggest focus and where we are going. Sitting at that booth inside your offices for my interview, I truly felt like an insider, not an outsider.

**Open Minded**

I also think this value is about being open to exploring opportunities. Embrace all ideas and be willing to take on big challenges that might seem scary at first, but that we can do it together as a team.

### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

Communication is one of the most critical things about being a PM. Engineers should not be told what to build. They should be told why we're building it. Colleagues shouldn‚Äôt just see the end result of what we build. They should know the journey we took. I think being honest and open about what we‚Äôre doing is incredibly important. I also think a PM should always be open about mistakes and take blame when something did not work.

For me personally, the feeling of having nothing to hide is very liberating and allows me to express my true self - that is critical for building a world class company culture and attracting the best, most authentic people to the team.

## Fit for Purpose üí™üèª


### What it Means

I believe this value is about making sure what we do solves the problem and meets the objective we set out. We don‚Äôt do things for the sake of it, but are very intentional about what we build for our community and make sure there is a reason for working on something or pursuing an initiative.

We don‚Äôt try to make things more attractive by trying to add lots of features, details and decorations. We are focused on diligently solving the job or problem at hand.


### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

I love building things that solve a problem and have a clear purpose. This is why I like to spend a lot of time understanding the problems before coming up with solutions. 'Fit for Purpose' is rooted in sound product principles. As Product Managers, we always ask why - why are we working on this? Why would this help our Posters and Taskers? It means that what we build has purpose and intention and is aimed at achieving a user and business outcome.

I don‚Äôt like making things over indulgent and over complex. What I build needs to be simple enough that it achieves what we set out to do, without needing to go over the top. When we say we don‚Äôt embellish, it means that a PM must know what a features are enough to have value for customers and solve the intended purpose, and at what point we‚Äôre able to ship. This means we might not spend that extra 2 weeks adding all those additional things we think are really cool, because we know what we‚Äôve done is enough to ship and solve the problem at hand.

In essence, 'Fit for Purpose' provides me an anchor to bring things back and make sure any decision we make is solving the job we care about.


## People Matter üíô


### What it Means

Both our internal employees and our community members (Posters and Taskers) are not just cogs in a wheel. They are all unique individuals who contribute to our organisation and society in a very meaningful way.

This value relates Internal stakeholders (i.e. the Airtasker team) and how we treat each other. Not putting results ahead of relationships (striking that balance between achieving results and building relationships). This means treating each other with respect and helping out each other to get tasks done.

I believe ‚ÄòPeople Matter‚Äô also relates to our external stakeholders (our Taskers and Posters that enable us to exist). Each user is unique in the job that is being posted and the skills that Taskers have to offer. I love and adopt Richard Branson‚Äôs philosophy, which I think sums up this value pretty well:

> look after your internal customers the way you want them to look after your external customers


### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

This value is demonstrated through communication, teamwork and by valuing each individual on our team ‚Äì their diversity, views, situations, strengths, and to leverage that to achieve Airtasker‚Äôs mission. It's also about ensuring that work is not a means to an end and that our individual team members feel inspired about the work they do passionate about being here.

My role as a PM is a people role, enabling each member of my time to do what they do best to help solve problems and improve the lives of millions of people. This means ensuring everyone's ideas are heard and their contribution valued.

I also think this principle applies to my philosophies on user feedback. When we get a customer complaint or a bad review, it's easy to look at the overwhelming volume of feedback coming through and forget that each of those pieces of feedback is from a real person who experienced something really bad with our product. I know personally how it feels to have contact a company's support team about a frustrating issue, and we need to remember that when our users speak to us.

## When its On its On ‚ö°Ô∏è

### What it Means

We work hard to get our work done and ship value to customers, and take pride in that. However, there is more to work than just working hard. When we achieve something, ship something to customers, have a great outcome from the work we‚Äôve done, we celebrate the win and acknowledge all of the people who made it possible.

We oscillate between these two modes and find a successful balance. If we don‚Äôt take the time to take the foot off the break and celebrate our success, then we will never be effective and will burn out. We cannot get innovation, creativity and new ideas when we are overloaded, Likewise, if we always celebrate and party, we‚Äôll never be a results-oriented company.


### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

For me, this means work hard, play hard and celebrate achievements. Knowing when it is crunch time, deadline and pressure, and knowing when we are not doing our best work if we have not planned properly, and have rushed into things for the sake of it.

As a PM, I need to make sure we not only ship, but deliver something valuable to users that achieves a business result. I take my work very seriously and push hard to get projects over the line and reach our objectives in time. When we achieve an amazing result, there's no better feeling then sharing it with the team and letting everyone feel proud in the contribution they've made to our customers lives and our business success.

## Own it üíØ

### What it Means

This means being proactive, taking ownership, and taking accountability and responsibility for our ideas, behaviour, actions and outcomes. It's about being assertive, open and honest but with respect for others. It's having a culture where it's okay to speak up and not feel scared to share ideas, be open and honest about strengths/improvements, and what is working well/could work better.


### What this Looks Like for me Personally and as a PM

This value of owning it as a PM also means take ownership of the problem we're tasked with solving, the user we're solving it for and the business outcome we're trying to achieve. It's owning our roadmap and making sure what we build aligns to our mission of empowering people to realize the full value of their skills. Ultimately, it is about owning my role of being ‚Äúthe voice of the user‚Äù and grounding the team back to the problem we are solving and who we are solving it for.

As a PM, I need to absorb blame all the time instead of deflect. At the end of the day, I am responsible for the success of what we ship and so I need to demonstrate to my peers that I take that responsibility and would never wrongfully blame others.

It's also about speaking up when I have an opinion on something and encouraging my team to do the same. As a PM, I want all my team members to share their ideas, feedback and criticism because it's them that have the best ideas, not me.
