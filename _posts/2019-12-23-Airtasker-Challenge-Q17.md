**Question 17:** *What excites you about Airtasker and the opportunity?*

___

I want you guys to know that this PM role at Airtasker is the only role I‚Äôve applied for (and I‚Äôm not looking to apply elsewhere). When Jerome got in touch with me about the opportunity to join your team as a PM, I was beyond excited (I actually missed his first email so god bless the follow up email üôèüèª).

I am very intentional about my desire to join you. I‚Äôm not looking to just be a product manager at a cool tech company in Sydney. I specifically want to be a part of the Airtasker team and have been an admirer for a long time.

I remember when Airtasker first launched. My friends and I were going through the app and couldn‚Äôt believe some of the quirky, wacky tasks posted on the platform. We considered taking a job which required giving someone a ride to Melbourne, but chickened out last minute.

So I kept an eye on Airtasker and how the company progressed. I even recommended them to my dad when he wanted to get rid of this enormous tree in our front garden that kept dropping these horrible, sticky orange fruits. My brother and I used to have to pick thousands of these fruit up every week, until I turned around to my dad and said:

> Dad, go on Airtasker and get somebody here to get rid of this bloody thing.

He did. It was an awesome experience to see the magic of Airtasker in person.

Then, in 2015 while at uni I started an organization called StartUp Link to improve student access to the startup world and provide them opportunities in awesome, promising tech companies. Besides placing dozens of students in startup jobs, and growing a community from 0 to over 1,000, one of my proudest moments was hosting a UNSW Alumni Entrepreneur event..... hosted by Jono Lui, the co-founder of Airtasker!

I knew for a long time that Tim and Jono were ex-UNSW students so I really wanted to get one of them to headline our event. I originally reached out to Tim, who was so lovely in responding but said he was under the pump. He put me onto Jono who had the availability and was able to headline our event. He was amazing and gave so much insight into what it took to start and grow Airtasker into such an amazing company.

As a product manager, I think it‚Äôs very hard to work on something you aren‚Äôt passionate about. So the main reason I want to work here and what excites me about the opportunity is to be a part of something I truly believe in and can fight for every day.

You are leading the way for shaping the future of work. I fundamentally believe that the work people do on Airtasker will in the next 30 years become a primary way of making a living, not just a side gig. I think the future of work is autonomous, selective and highly varied, and I couldn‚Äôt think of anything more exciting than joining a group of driven and aligned people to help push that future forward.

I think Airtasker has done so much, yet has so far to go to fulfil its mission. I really want to hop on the ride and be able to contribute.

Besides my excitement in joining you on your mission, a secondary reason why I want this opportunity that is I‚Äôd love to work with intelligent people who can mentor me. I like to listen a lot more than I speak, so I think with so many talented people in one place, I can learn a fortune and grow a lot personally and professionally.

I was incredibly excited when you said you‚Äôre in the process of building a world class product management team. I think there are some very talented product people at Airtasker, and Product Management is so important to me. The learning I will gain from being amongst the world class Airtasker Product team would be invaluable and help me unlock my potential as a PM and <strong><u>realize the full value of my skills</u></strong>. Plus, I like to be on the journey of building something amazing from the foundations - that ride really excites me.
