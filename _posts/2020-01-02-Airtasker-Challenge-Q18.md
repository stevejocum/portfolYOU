**Question 16:** *What would you like us to know about you?*

## Background and education

I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and migrated to Sydney at the age of 4 with my older brother and parents. My parents sacrificed a lot so that my brother and I could live a safer life in Australia. Having seen the hardships people face in South Africa, I feel very lucky to call myself an Australian. I am also proud to be Jewish and feel close to my heritage and community.

Family and relationships are very important to me, especially considering all my grandparents, cousins, aunties and uncles are overseas.

I feel privileged to have had the amazing education that I did, having gone to Emanuel Private school, then to UNSW for my Finance and IT degree. I started an organization at UNSW called Start Up Link to connect students to opportunities in startups and build an infrastructure for students to be hired by startups as a career path during and after uni.

While at UNSW I went on a 6 - month USA Exchange to the University of North Carolina. I feel that in my university years, I gained much of my life experience and maturity, having learnt to be a leader and to live independently.

## Passions

I have always been entrepreneurial at heart - engrossed in business, technology, startups from a young age (buying products overseas and selling them at school). I became more and more interested in tech and startups - it absolutely fascinated me that people could create something out of nothing through technology which enabled totally new ways of doing things. It excites me that a company like yours (Airtasker) exists because 2 people had an idea and brought it to life through software, connecting people who needed random jobs done with those willing to do it for cash.

I asked myself where I could make the most impact in exciting tech companies - solving amazing problems to push the world forward, and naturally veered to Product Management. It is the perfect blend of what I love, what I‚Äôm competent at, and what the world needs (my sweet spot!).

I love psychology and understanding people, so thinking about the user and their problems comes natural to me. My favourite part about my job is listening to users. I've conducted hundreds of hours of user interviews and it's the closest I feel to being a registered psychologist üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è. I also love design and software - how technology can enable incredible new ways of doing things. I love business, so I‚Äôm always concerned about what the business impact is from what we are building. I also love seeing how customer feedback translates into positive customer/user experience.

I am grateful for the experience I have gained through Start Up Link that I led, then working part time/internships while at uni at various start ups, leading to a full time PM role at Simply Wall St, where I am now.

I have played a critical part in building our business to a multi-million-dollar yearly revenue business. I joined when there were 50,000 registered users, a few hundred paying customers and 4 staff. Now we have over 1.5 million users, almost 20,000 paid customers and close to 20 employees.

As the company‚Äôs first Product Manager, I‚Äôve established the practices and processes and frameworks we use to validate problems and ship amazing products. I believe that I could contribute significantly as a PM at Airtasker, and that I could add value to shape our product roadmap and vision.

## Hobbies

Physical activity is very important to me, which I love doing and enjoy. I regularly work out at the gym and love to do handstands ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (I can hold them for over a minute!). I played soccer and tennis growing up, and still play socially. I have a passion for sport and love watching tennis, AFL and EPL football (I'm a big Swannies and Arsenal fan!).

<br>

I have a love for cooking, playing the piano, reading and listening to books/podcasts on personal growth, development, tech, startups, entrepreneurship and psychology. I‚Äôm a book nerd (you can check out my <a href="https://trello.com/b/hU6iwmbR/books" target="_blank">never ending reading list</a>) and regularly read up on things that may improve the task I am working on in my career. I am passionate about financial literacy and feel that young people should be given the skills to live an economically secure lifestyle to the best of their ability.

Relationships are very important to me. I am family orientated, care deeply for my friends and colleagues and love to give back to my community, having volunteered for charities such as Eastern Respite, Cancer Chicks Australia and StartUp Link. I recently participated in Movember to raise awareness of men‚Äôs cancer and mental health. The past year I have been supporting my girlfriend through cancer (lymphoma), chemotherapy and a challenging time. I am grateful that she is well again.  

I have a habit for talking to anyone and listening intently to everyone I meet. I love to learn from and about others. I believe there is something to learn from every person, no matter who they are.

## Personality and characteristics

Those who know me personally and at work say that I am warm, personable, empathetic, loyal, hard-working and dedicated. I am a strong leader, team player, and am motivated, perseverant and thorough. I am curious, innovative, and bring together my knowledge, experience and love of business, tech and people. I have a great sense of humour, don't take myself too seriously and love to cry of laughter üòÇ.
