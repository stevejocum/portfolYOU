**Question 10:** *Your colleague is working on a new Subscriptions model that allows a Poster to subscribe to a given service (e.g. lawn mowing). They are not sure if the Poster would be willing to commit to a long-term Subscription from the get-go. They're also concerned that once the Poster and Tasker meet in person, the Poster would cancel the Subscription to shave off a few dollars of commission. How might your colleague's team resolve these problems?*

## Intro and Thanks

Firstly, thank you for the opportunity to complete this challenge and for reading through my work. I loved every minute of the 2 and a half weeks I spent on it (roughly 24 hours of actual work).
