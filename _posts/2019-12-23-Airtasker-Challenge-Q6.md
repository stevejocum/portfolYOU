**Question 6:** *A colleague suggests we should send more emails to re-engage our users. You check the data and find that 20% of tasks posted onto Airtasker are attributed to email in Google Analytics and the trend is increasing. What can you conclude?*

---

When we say 20% of tasks posted to Airtasker are attributed to email, I assume that means a user posts a task directly as a result of coming from an email (`user opens email`->`clicks link to platform`->`posts task`).

Immediately, we {% include elements/highlight.html text="cannot conclude from these facts alone that we should be sending more emails to re-engage our users" %}. I‚Äôd first want to explore a few areas before drawing a conclusion.

## Contribution of email relative to other channels

I‚Äôd want to know what the other 80% comprises of and break it down by channel. For example, say we have 8 channels from which we attribute tasks getting posted on the platform to. I'd want to know how significantly do each contribute to the total. Is email our biggest source at 20% and the remaining attributions are all lower? Or is there an attribution which 50% of tasks get posted from and therefore email is just a small minority of the contribution to users posting tasks to the platform?

If email is significant compared to our other sources, I would more confidently conclude that it is a area we should look to optimise and spend more time on.

Some of the sources I would attribute to users posting a task are:
- **Email**
- **Push notifications**
- **Social Media**
- **Direct** (people who hear and know about Airtasker and come directly to our site from their browser, sign up, create an account and post a task)
- **Organic Search** (This would include anybody coming to us from Search via our SEO. Whilst not critical for a cursory look, I would later on want to slice this data to see how many tasks posted from organic search are attributed to landing pages such as <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/accounting/" target="_blank">Accounting Tasks on Airtasker</a> or simply our <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/accounting/" target="_blank">Home Page</a> where users can click 'Get Started Now' to post their task. Both of those go through the 'post a task' flow and require the user to create an account to finish the post)
- **Referral** (someone posting a task after receiving a referral coupon from another user)
- **Paid Advertising** (includes search ads, social media ads, ad campaigns)
- **N/A** (existing users logging back into the app to post their task without attribution)

<br>

The first scenario would be much more compelling for me to conclude that we should be spending more time on re-engaging users with email, considering the channel accounts for majority of users posting tasks. With the latter, I'd consider first doubling down on the best performing channel, like SEO. I'd consider spending time on email re-engagement if there was enough bandwidth amongst our product and growth teams.


## Growth over time of posts coming from email

So far, what we would have seen is simply a snapshot at a point in time, but the question mentioned that the email trend is increasing. I‚Äôd like to see {% include elements/highlight.html text="how significant that increase is" %}. For example, even though email may represent 20% and organic search represents 30%, if email grew from 10% last year, that is a 100% or 2x increase, and therefore may be worth us continuing to try grow that channel. Additionally, channels which are currently performing better than email may be shrinking and therefore we may want to spend our time on the growth areas of the business like email re-engagement.

## Which emails specifically are driving the results

Before making conclusions, I would also want to know what types of emails comprise that 20%. Of all the emails we send to users, knowing which specific emails are driving the efficacy will help us better understand what is actually contributing to the tasks being posted. Is it a welcome email after they‚Äôve signed up? Is it a reminder email for users that have draft tasks to complete their post? We may find one type of email accounts for 75% of all tasks being posted from this channel.

## Quality of tasks coming from email

The overall {% include elements/highlight.html text="health of a marketplace isn't determined by the number of jobs available, it is the number of jobs completed" %}. As my final step before drawing a conclusion, I‚Äôd want to look at whether the tasks posted from emails led to high quality outcomes for users and drove meaningful engagement in the platform.

<br>

I'd want to see what percentage of tasks posted which are attributed to email end up completed and paid. The highest value task for a Tasker, Poster and our business are those which get completed and all parties get the outcome they wanted:

‚úÖ Happy Poster

‚úÖ Happy Tasker

‚úÖ Happy Business (us!)

I'd then want to compare this to the other channels to see how it stacks up against the rest. If it is significantly lower, then that's a problem and I'd want to dig further to understand why the tasks being posted from our email channel are not high quality. For example, we may send out an email about draft tasks the user has waiting to be posted, nudging them to complete the flow. Looking at those tasks posted from that email, we may see that the post description, categorization and pricing are poor and therefore they didn't receive any offers. Perhaps we should be doing a better job at guiding the user to post a high quality task instead of just driving them to get it posted quickly.
